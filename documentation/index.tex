\chapter{Library Interface Documentation}

\section{\texttt{namespace primordialmachine}}
The namespace this library is adding its declarations/definitions to.
The added namespace elements are documented below.

\section{\textit{Math.NonScalar} (type concept)}
A \textit{Math.NonScalar} type is a fixed size container for   \textit{Math.Scalar}
type elements which can be accessed for reading an writing using different indexing
schemes. Matrices, points, and vectors are examples of      \textit{Math.NonScalar}
types. 

\subsection{Element type}
The \textit{Math.Scalar} type $E$ of the elements of a \textit{Math.NonScalar} type
$T$ can be obtained by the member type definition\newline
\texttt{element\_type\textlangle $T$\textrangle::type}\newline
or the type definition\newline
\texttt{element\_type\_t\textlangle$T$\textrangle}\newline

\subsection{Number of elements}
The number of elements of a \textit{Math.NonScalar} type $T$ can be obtained by
the constant expression \textit{size\_t} member constant\newline
\texttt{number\_of\_elements\textlangle $T$\textrangle::value}\newline
or by the constant expression \textit{size\_t} constant\newline
\texttt{number\_of\_elements\_v\textlangle $T$\textrangle}\newline

\subsection{Degenerate and non-degenerate}
A \textit{Math.NonScalar} type $T$ called \textit{degenerate} if and only if it has zero elements.
Otherwise it is called \textit{non-degenerate}.

If a \textit{Math.NonScalar} type $T$ is degenerate can be obtained by
the constant expression \textit{bool} member constant\newline
\texttt{is\_degenerate\textlangle $T$\textrangle::value}\newline
or by the constant expression \textit{bool} constant\newline
\texttt{is\_degenerate\_v\textlangle $T$\textrangle}\newline

If a \textit{Math.NonScalar} type $T$ is non-degenerate can be obtained by
the constant expression \textit{bool} member constant\newline
\texttt{is\_non\_degenerate\textlangle $T$\textrangle::value}\newline
or by the constant expression \textit{bool} constant\newline
\texttt{is\_non\_degenerate\_v\textlangle $T$\textrangle}\newline

\subsection{Dimensionality $=0$}
A \textit{Math.NonScalar} of dimensionality $=0$ is a type $T$
which provides support for the following   operations:\newline

%BEGIN OPERATIONS%
\texttt{$T$(const $T$\& other)}\textit{(copy constructor)}\newline
\texttt{$T$\& operator=(const $T$\& other)}\textit{(copy assignment operator)}\newline
%END OPERATIONS%

\subsection{Dimensionality $=1$}
A \textit{Math.NonScalar} of dimensionality $=1$ provides the     same
operations as a \textit{Math.NonScalar} type of   dimensionality $=0$.
In addition, it provides support for the following operations:\newline

%BEGIN OPERATIONS%
\texttt{const element\_type\& operator()(size\_t i) const}\textit{(constant unary indexing operator})\newline
\texttt{element\_type\& operator()(size\_t i)} \textit{(unary indexing operator)}\newline
%END OPERATIONS%

\subsection{Dimensionality $>1$}
A \textit{Math.NonScalar} of dimensionality $>1$ provides the     same
operations as a \textit{Math.NonScalar} type of   dimensionality $=1$.
In addition, it provides support for the following operations:\newline

%BEGIN OPERATIONS%
\texttt{const element\_type\& operator()(\textit{IndexList}) const} \textit{(constant $n > 1$-ary indexing operator)}\newline
\texttt{element\_type\& operator()(\textit{IndexList})} \textit{($n > 1$-ary indexing operator)}\newline
%END OPERATIONS%

where \texttt{\textit{IndexList}} are $n$ \texttt{size\_t} values
denoting indices and where $n$ is the dimensionality of      $T$.\newline

Every \textit{Math.NonScalar} of dimensionality $n > 1$     must define a
bijection between the indices $i$ passed to the unary \texttt{operator()}
and the indices $i_0,\ldots,i_{n-1}$ passed to the            $n > 1$-ary
\texttt{operator()}.\newline

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Example]
Row-major $N \times M$ matrices where $N$ is the   number of
rows and $M$ is the number of columns can fulfil         the
\textit{Math.NonScalar} type concept of  dimensionality $2$:
First, provide th $2$ index operators such that the first
index denotes the row index and the second index      the
column index.
Second, provide the $1$ index   operators and define the
bijection between an index $i$ passed to the $1$   index
operator and the first index $j$   and the second index:
A possible bijection can be defined in terms of a    row
major mapping as $k$ as $i / N + i\mod M= j \cdot M +k$.
